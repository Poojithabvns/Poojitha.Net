Auto Rename Tag - automatically rename the closing tag
bracket pari colorizer - is deprecated as the vs code got it inbuilt- just enable in the settings 
Angular Files - healps to create files, components etc by just right clicking on the folder ( this can also be done from the terminal using ng generate component component_name or ng g c component_name)
