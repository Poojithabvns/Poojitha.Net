What is Angular - A javascript framework to develop SPA ( Single Page Application)
Why Angular - it's efficient, fast, and easy to integrate with other platforms. 
current Angular version is 19.1.2
I have installed node.js as it is required for the developement environment and also for all the dependencies required for this project
open power shell and run Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force
although the video showed for version angular 9 it was running on command prompt, it did not work for me and had run the next command on powershell
ran the >npm install -g @angular/cli@latest to install angular
ng --version to check the version
ng new property-app to create a new angular workspace
cd property-app to enter the workspace
ng serve to compile 
once ran the local path is shared which after opening can see the basic angular based property-app html page
ctrl+c to exit the workspace application from running
to open the code in visual studio run code . and the vs shows the property-app folder and its components in the visual studio application
